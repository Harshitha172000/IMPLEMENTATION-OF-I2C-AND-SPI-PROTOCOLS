# Design and Implementation of I2C and SPI Protocols

> **AIM:** The aim of the project is set as designing and development of I2C and SPI protocols in a simulation environment using verilog <hr>
## Description:

**I2C:**

Inter-Integrated Circuit or Two wire interface is a serial Communication Protocol which is half Duplex. Widely used for short distance, intra-board communication.
I2C connects devices like Microcontrollers, EEPROMS, A/D and D/A converters, I/O interfaces and other similar peripheral interfaces in Embedded Systems.

*TRANSMISSION OF DATA IN I2C BUS*

1. *IDEAL STATE:* When no data is transmitted between master and slave then SDA and SCL lines are at high logic.
2. *Start Condition:* SDA line goes from high logic to low logic while SCL line remains  at high logic. This is called "start signal".
3. *Slave Address:* 7-bit address of target slave is transmitted.
4. *ACK:* Slave will generate a 1-bit signal to acknowledge master.
5. *Data Transfer:* 8-bit data is transmitted over SDA line in an order such that  MSB is   transmitted first and LSB at last.
6. *ACK2:* An acknowledge signal is again generated by the slave when a byte (8-bit) is received from mater.
7. *Stop Condition:* SDA line goes from low logic to high logic and SCL line remains high, this is called as "stop signal".

**SPI:**

Serial Peripheral Interface is a synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short-distance communication primarily in embedded systems. Chips, microprocessors and FGPA based designs uses SPI to communicate between internal components in a more faster and efficient way.

1. *Data transmission:* The SPI bus operates with single master device and one or multiple slave devices.
2. *Modes numbers of SPI*: The combinations of clock polarity and phase are often referred to as modes.

## Implementation:

1.**Implementation of I2C master and slave:**

The initial steps of the implementation of the project was with the start of the implementation of the I2C master and slave codes in a simulation IDE. The codes were built in verilog language. Initial codes for master and slave were developed and was tested repeatedly and modified for various test bench to get precise outputs. The clock cycles were kept slow to match the actual behavior of I2C.

2.**Implementation of SPI master and slave:**

Once the I2C codes and test bench was precised the focus was shifted towards SPI. The objectice was to develop SPI master and slave using verilog. Codes were developed and checked repeatedly with various test bench to to get the output precisely.
